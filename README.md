#Singular Value Decomposition of Operators on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces

##Abstract[^*]

Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) play an important role in many statistics
and machine learning applications ranging from support vector machines to Gaussian
processes  and  kernel  embeddings  of  distributions.   Operators  acting  on  such  spaces
are,  for  instance,  required  to  embed  conditional  probability  distributions  in  order  to
implement  the  kernel  Bayes  rule  and  build  sequential  data  models.   It  was  recently
shown that transfer operators such as the Perron–Frobenius or Koopman operator can
also be approximated in a similar fashion using covariance and cross-covariance operators
and that eigenfunctions of these operators can be obtained by solving associated matrix
eigenvalue  problems.   The  goal  of  this  paper  is  to  provide  a  solid  functional  analytic
foundation  for  the  eigenvalue  decomposition  of  RKHS  operators  and  to  extend  the
approach to the singular value decomposition.  The results are illustrated with simple
guiding examples.
